# cdm

**Class:** EGS-CC Tools

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux

A commandline tool for modifying EGS-CC CDMs

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the cdm commandline tool after it has been built, you can call:

```
cdm help
```

This should work both under Windows (where cdm is expanded to cdm.bat automagically) and Linux (where the cdm shell script is executed.)
